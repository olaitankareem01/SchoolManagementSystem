# SCHOOL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

###### PURPOSE:

The rationale of this system is to replace the existing manual school management system that had produced inconvenience not only to the students but also to the school administration. Our goal is to develop a secure, fast, accurate, and user-friendly system.

###### SCOPE:

The application is a web based school management system that currently manages:
*Enrollment
*Admission process
*student registration
*student records
*staff records
*class records
\*school events

###### MODELS:

*students
*class
*contact
*user
*roles
*applicant
\*class category

###### HOW IT WORKS:

The system allows an applicant to enroll through the sytem.The applicant is required to fill and submit his details accordingly through the application form.The details submitted by the applicant is properly validated and saved(if there's no error).The Registrar of the school or the super admin of the system has the permission to admit or reject(based on certain conditions required by the school management).If an applicant is sucessfully admitted,a notification mail is sent to him and he is automatically registered as a student and a student profile is automatically created for him.The admin or registrar can also register applicants (who probably enrolled physically) as students.

Everyone using the system is considered as a user and are assigned different roles.
The system has the following categories of user:
*admin
*registrar
*principal
*student
\*proprietor
Some of records cannot be altered or modified by other users (students, registrar, cashier & teachers) except for the super administrator (the only one who have full access to the system) while some are accessible to only authorized users.The super admin is responsible for assigning roles to other users,the registrar,principal,proprietor,student and any other role assigned by the admin can only perform action which they are authorized to perform.
